# Movie App

This is a simple movie app that allows users to add, remove, and view movies. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Getting Started

To use this app, you simply need to download the code and open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Features

- Add a new movie: Click the "Add Movie" button in the header, fill in the form, and click "Add Movie" to add a new movie to the list.  
- Remove a movie: Click the delete icon on a movie, and then confirm that you want to delete the movie.  
- View movies: All added movies will be displayed on the main page.  

### Code Explanation

The code is split into two sections: variables and functions. The variables section sets up the variables needed for the app to work, including references to the HTML elements, an empty array to store the movies, and functions to manipulate the elements.

The functions section includes the functions that handle events triggered by the user, including adding a movie, deleting a movie, closing the modal, showing the modal, clearing the input fields, and updating the user interface.
